# Lab 6 - Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains **Lab 6 - Unsupervised Learning**, where we explore key concepts of **unsupervised machine learning**, including **clustering methods** (like K-Means) and **dimensionality reduction** techniques (such as PCA). The notebook demonstrates how to uncover hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs.

## 📂 Files  
**Lab6_Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook implementing:  
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar data points automatically
- **Elbow Method**: Determining the optimal number of clusters
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Measuring clustering quality
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality for visualization
- **t-SNE Visualization**: Mapping high-dimensional data to 2D for intuitive understanding

---

## 🚀 Usage  
Run the notebook to **apply clustering algorithms**, **evaluate cluster quality**, and **visualize high-dimensional datasets** using dimensionality reduction techniques.

---

## 📊 Key Results  
- **K-Means effectively separates data into meaningful clusters** based on feature similarities.
- **The Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores guide the choice of cluster numbers** to avoid under/overfitting.
- **PCA and t-SNE help visualize complex datasets** and reveal structure in an unsupervised setting.
